            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <pre>
                Verse 1  
                What a joy it is to know you,  
                Let thy faith fail not,  
                A project steals thy peace,  
                While anxiety knocks at the door.  

                Chorus  
                Let your heart, my princess,  
                Be yielded unto Christ.  
                He is your strength,  
                He is your hope,  
                In every moment of strife.  

                Verse 2  
                Trust that your answer is Christ,  
                The hope of glory bright.  
                I’m here for you, I’m praying,  
                With you, my darling, through the night.  

                Chorus  
                Remember always our Lord, my love,  
                In joy and in despair.  
                He will be your go-to,  
                Christ, the hope of glory, always there.  

                Bridge  
                I may not have the answers,  
                But I believe this truth:  
                Christ alone can satisfy,  
                Your soul, my love, it’s you.  

                Verse 3  
                I will be here always,  
                As long as I shall live,  
                To make you happy, please you,  
                My love, I treasure what you give.  

                Chorus  
                Remember always our Lord, my love,  
                In joy and in despair.  
                He will be your go-to,  
                Christ, the hope of glory, always there.  

                Outro  
                And I pray that Christ works in me,  
                To love you God’s way,  
                Forever and always, my dove,  
                In every single day.
